This keylogger was made as an experiment so I could learn how BadUSBs worked on Flipper Zero.
It was made with educational purposes in mind, and I do not take any responsibility for any harm caused with this program.

Features:
> A keylogger that downloads through Powershell when the Flipper is connected to the Windows machine.
> Persistance built-in so the script stays running even after a reboot.
> The script sends the logged keystrokes to a Discord server of your choice, using a Discord webhook.

This is all experimental and has yet to be tested. I have not been able to yet because of my inability to aquire a spare Windows machine to test it on.
